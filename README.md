## 📝 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I tackle one coding problem each day for 100 days. The problems are sourced from various coding platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal. My aim is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and become more proficient in coding.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- **Consistency**: Solve one coding problem every day for 100 days.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed notes and explanations for each problem solved.
- **Learning**: Explore different algorithms and data structures.
- **Efficiency**: Improve the time and space complexity of my solutions.
